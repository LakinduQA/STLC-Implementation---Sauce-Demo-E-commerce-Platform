## Test Automation Framework Architecture

### Framework Design Pattern: Page Object Model

```javascript
// Page Objects Structure
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── LoginPage.js
│   ├── InventoryPage.js
│   ├── CartPage.js
│   └── CheckoutPage.js
├── tests/
│   ├── authentication.spec.js
│   ├── inventory.spec.js
│   ├── cart.spec.js
│   └── checkout.spec.js
├── utils/
│   ├── testData.js
│   └── helpers.js
└── config/
    └── playwright.config.js
```

### Sample Test Implementation

```javascript
// Example: Login Test Case
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { LoginPage } from "../pages/LoginPage";
import { InventoryPage } from "../pages/InventoryPage";

test("Valid User Login", async ({ page }) => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
  const inventoryPage = new InventoryPage(page);

  await loginPage.navigate();
  await loginPage.login("standard_user", "secret_sauce");

  await expect(inventoryPage.inventoryContainer).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*inventory.html/);
});
```

### Automation Test Coverage (15 Test Scripts)

## Network Analysis Strategy

### Network Traffic Identification

**Method**: Network traffic analysis during manual testing to identify backend form submission patterns

### Postman Collection Structure (10 Test Scenarios)

```
Sauce Demo Network Analysis Collection
├── Authentication Flow
│   ├── Login Form Submission Analysis
│   ├── Invalid Login Response Validation
│   ├── Session Cookie Verification
│   └── Logout Request Analysis
├── Form Validation Testing
│   ├── Checkout Form Submission
│   ├── Required Field Validation
│   └── Form Data Structure Analysis
└── Performance Monitoring
    ├── Page Load Time Analysis
    ├── Resource Loading Validation
    └── Network Request Monitoring
```

### Network Analysis Approach

- **Form Submission Validation**: Verify form POST requests and response handling
- **Status Code Verification**: Validate HTTP response codes (200, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- **Response Time Testing**: Ensure form submission performance meets acceptable thresholds
- **Data Validation**: Verify form data structure and response formats
- **Error Handling**: Test invalid form submissions and boundary conditions

## Performance Testing Implementation
