## 🎯 Test Execution Strategy

### **Multi-Browser Validation**

#### **Desktop Browsers**

1. **Google Chrome** - Primary browser for baseline testing
2. **Mozilla Firefox** - Cross-browser compatibility validation
3. **Safari (WebKit)** - Apple ecosystem compatibility
4. **Microsoft Edge** - Enterprise browser support

#### **Mobile Browsers**

1. **Mobile Chrome** - Android mobile experience
2. **Mobile Safari** - iOS mobile experience

### **Test Data Strategy**

- **User Accounts**: 4 different user types (Standard, Problem, Performance Glitch, Locked Out)
- **Product Data**: 6 product catalog items with various price points
- **Customer Data**: Multiple customer information sets for checkout testing
- **Environment**: Sauce Demo production environment (https://www.saucedemo.com/v1/)

## 📊 Test Execution Metrics

### **Success Criteria**

- **Smoke Tests**: 100% pass rate (blocking if failed)
- **Regression Tests**: ≥95% pass rate
- **E2E Tests**: 100% pass rate for critical flows
- **Performance**: Page load times <3 seconds
- **Cross-Browser**: Consistent behavior across all browsers

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

- Test execution time per browser
- Defect detection rate
- Test stability (flaky test identification)
- Browser-specific issues
- Mobile vs Desktop performance comparison

---

## 🔍 Defect Management Strategy

### **Defect Classification**

#### **Severity Levels**

- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Major functionality broken, blocking user flows
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, workarounds available
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests

#### **Priority Levels**

- **P1**: Fix immediately (blocks release)
- **P2**: Fix before release
- **P3**: Fix in next release
- **P4**: Fix when time permits

### **Defect Reporting Process**

1. **Immediate Documentation**: Screenshot, video, logs capture
2. **Environment Details**: Browser, OS, viewport size
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
4. **Expected vs Actual**: Clear comparison of behaviors
5. **Impact Assessment**: Business impact evaluation

## 📈 Test Execution Tracking

### **Real-Time Monitoring**

- Live test execution dashboard
- Pass/fail rate tracking
- Performance metrics monitoring
- Error pattern identification
- Browser-specific issue tracking

### **Reporting Schedule**

- **Hourly Updates**: Test execution progress
- **Daily Summary**: Test results and defect summary
- **End of Week**: Comprehensive test execution report

---

## 🚀 Test Environment Setup

### **Prerequisites Validation**

- ✅ Node.js and npm installed
- ✅ Playwright browsers installed
- ✅ Framework dependencies resolved
- ✅ Test data configured
- ✅ Environment connectivity verified

### **Execution Commands**

```bash
# Complete test suite execution
npm test

# Smoke tests only
npm run test:smoke

# Regression tests only
npm run test:regression

# E2E tests only
npm run test:e2e

# Single browser execution
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Parallel execution (faster)
npx playwright test --workers=4
```
