## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### Technical Lessons Learned

#### 1. Automation Framework Development

**Lessons:**

- **Data Type Consistency:** Ensure consistent data types across page objects and tests
- **Method Implementation:** Complete all page object methods before test development
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Framework Architecture:** Use Page Object Model for maintainability and reusability

**Best Practices Established:**

```javascript
// Consistent data type handling
getCartBadgeCount() {
    return this.cartBadge.textContent().toString(); // Always return string
}

// Robust error handling
async navigateToCheckout() {
    try {
        await this.checkoutButton.click();
        await this.page.waitForURL('**/checkout-step-one.html', { timeout: 10000 });
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Checkout navigation failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
}

// Comprehensive validation methods
async verifyCartPageElements() {
    const elements = await Promise.all([
        this.cartList.isVisible(),
        this.continueShoppingButton.isVisible(),
        this.checkoutButton.isVisible()
